Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `app.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

# Messenger Platform Quick Start

Welcome to your first step toward building awesome Messenger apps!

This project contains the code for a simple webhook you can use to get started using the Messenger Platform.

The code here mirrors what is in our [webhook set up guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/webhook-setup), and may be used as the starting point for doing the [Messenger Platform quick start tutorial](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/quick-start).
